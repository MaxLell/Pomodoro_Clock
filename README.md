# Pomodoro_Clock

## Why?
This device forces me to take breaks in regular intervals throughout the day. Research has shown that the brain grows tired when being forced to focus on tasks on a prolonged time. (I think everybody can also observe this in his own life). But research also shows, that if you take regular breaks, you do not deplete your mental ressources as quickly and you can focus for longer hours.

So this is basically what this device (will) is about. It will sit on my desk and ping me, when I need to take a break, and not only ping me, but rather shine a bright light at me, so that I actually get my lazy a** up and move around for a couple of minutes - day in day out. 
You might say: Well you can also set a timer on your smartphone and go from there, to which I reply: Yeah you can, but if you want to do that day-in, day-out, you need a lot of will power and the most perfect habits the world has ever witnessed in man-kind. I am not such a person. 

And for this reason I built this device.

## What?
So what is this marvelous device I am talking about? Well I am glad you are asking: It is basically a box of lights, where you can set up the interval for which you want to work (the next cycle is composed of Worktime and Breaktime). Then it will run a countdown timer.

## How?
- This project is partially also a way for myself to learn and work on a complicated challenge: I already resolved the architecture of this multi-module Architecture (using a Message Broker, so that these modules only exchange data via this Messages-Interface - Observer Pattern). Or working on the implementation of high-speed low level peripherals, which require the usage of the DMA.
